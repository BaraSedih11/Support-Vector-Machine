This repository contains an Implementation of SVM's using pandas and sklearn in python.

## Overview

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful algorithm for classification which also finds the best boundary. We explored topics related to Maximum Margin Classifier, Classification with Inseparable Classes, and Kernel Methods.

## Contents

- `SVM.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of SVM's using Python.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset used in the notebook for demonstration purposes.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the repository.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaraSedih11/Support-Vector-Machine.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd SVM
```

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `SVM.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code and comments in the notebook to understand how SVM's is implemented using Python.
